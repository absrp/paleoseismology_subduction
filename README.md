<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A set of scripts to analyze the distribution of megathrust earthquakes in space and time, from the paleoseismic record. 

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The data is contained in xlsx file. It currently contains data from Philibosian and Meltzner (2020) only but will be expanded to incorporate additional datasets. 
The data for each subduction zone in the xlsx file can be plotted by running the megathrust_events Jupyter Notebook.

### Prerequisites

All prerequisites are listed in the conda environment's yml file.
