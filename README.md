# paleoseismology_subduction
A global catalog of paleoseismic data from subduction zones and a set of scripts to plot and analyze the event data

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The data is contained in xlsx file. It currently contains data compiled in Philibosian and Meltzner (2020), Dal Zilio et al. (2020), and Clark et al. (2019) but will be expanded to incorporate additional datasets. The original references are also included in the spreadsheet, based on what's reported in the compiling papers. 
The data for each subduction zone in the xlsx file can be plotted by running the megathrust_events Jupyter Notebook.
Subduction zones and compilation reference:

Himalaya - Dal Zilio et al. (2020)

Japan-Kurile - Philibosian and Meltzner (2020)

Nankai-Sagami - Philibosian and Meltzner (2020)

South America - Philibosian and Meltzner (2020)

Sumatra-Andaman - Philibosian and Meltzner (2020)

Hikurangi - Clark et al. (2019)

### Example catalog
Based on the compilation in Philibosian and Meltzner (2020)
